# DSA
A repo for my DSA practice.

## Content
1. Sorting : Bubble sort, Selection sort
2. Graphs : Adding nodes, listing edges, depth/breadth-first traversal, combination sum problem
3. Tower of Hanoi using recursion
4. N rooks and N Queens problem on a NxN chess board
5. knight walk : DFS and BFS based approach for moving a knight from one point to other on a NxN chess board
6. Linked lists : Traverse, pushback/front, insert/delete nodes
7. Trees : BST (insertion, pre/post/in/level order traversal)
8. DP : LCS, LIS, LPS, edit-distance, rod length cutting, coin-change, knapsack

## To do
* Merge sort, quick sort
* Knight's tour of board
* Travelling salesman
* Heaps, heapq module in python
* Trees : node deletion, subtree height,depth, properties, AVL trees
* Kadanes' Algo
